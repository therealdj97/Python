        "\n",
        "Video games creation is essentially a software development process.  A group of individuals or a company create a video game with the aim of massive profits. Generally, publishers such as EA Sports, Atari, Rockstar Games etc. fund the game development process. However, for publishers, it is very important to estimate the cost of development of a video game. Additionally, they also have to allocate the right amount of budget. If the budget is too little, the quality of a game will get compromised whereas if the budget is too much, their profit margin will reduce. Most of the commercial games do not generate adequate profit. \n",
        "\n",
        "A video game is an interactive visual story. A new game must provide novelty and must be a product of innovation. Otherwise, it may turn out repetitive and boring. Many individual groups of game developers shut down their development process and exit the market because they cannot find a publisher or they can't fund the development by themselves as the initial capital investment requirement is humongous. Nevertheless, once the companies become financially stable by making sufficient profits, they may expand to develop newer games or sequels to the initial ones such as FIFA, Call of Duty, Age of Empires etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "An average development budget for a multiplatform (PC, PS, Xbox etc.) game is US \\$18 to 28 million, with high-profile games often exceeding US $40 million.\n",
