If the coefficient of determination is equal to 1, then the correlation coefficient can be either -1 or +1
If the coefficient of determination is a positive value, then the regression equation could have either a positive or a negative slope

.	
If the correlation coefficient is a positive value, then the slope of the regression line can not be zero
